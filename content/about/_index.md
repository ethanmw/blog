I'm a software developer currently studying computer engineering at the University of Notre Dame. Learn more about me [here](https://ethanwilliams.me). This site is my blog for random thoughts about tech, politics, or pretty much anything else. It's also hosting my reading responses for a class called [Hackers in the Bazaar](https://www3.nd.edu/~pbui/teaching/cse.40842.sp19/).
