Stephen Levy writes that the "true hackers" at MIT in the fifties and sixties
were primarily identified by following a shared *hacker ethic*:

- Access to computers—and anything which might teach you something about the way
the world works—should be unlimited and total. Always yield to the Hands-On
Imperative!
- All information should be free.
- Mistrust authority—promote decentralization.
- Hackers should be judged by their hacking, not criteria such as degrees, age,
race, or position.
- You can create art and beauty on a computer.
- Computers can change your life for the better.

These were people who saw the potential of computers, despite the limitations of
those early machines. They weren't concerned with the disdain from the old
academics in the math department, and they weren't satisfied with the carefully
controlled and restricted computer access given by the "priests" in the Cult of
IBM. Instead they wanted to explore, push limits, and above all, create and
share their "hacks." And in this regard, they were admirable, and their work was
astonishing. When an academic named Herbert Dreyfus dismissed the field of
artificial intelligence, claiming that a computer couldn't beat a 10-year-old at
chess, hacker Richard Greenblatt wrote a chess program, invited Dreyfus to play,
and everyone watched as it summarily beat Dreyfus—all this on a machine with
only sixteen registers. They had a passion and a dedication to computing which
allowed them to push the envelope of computing to places most would have thought
laughable until they saw it happen.

However, they weren't perfect—far from it, in fact. In class we spoke of two
flaws of MIT's hacker community specifically: there were no women, and hacking
was so paramount to these men that it took the place of basic aspects of life:
relationships and social interactions, sleep, and personal hygiene (the latter
of which probably mutually reinforced the lack of women). Obviously these are
concerns, but I don't think they necessarily invalidate the ideal of the *true
hacker*.

While it is true that Levy doesn't mention sex in his third tenet of the hacker
ethic, I believe gender equality is in the spirit of the ethic as much as age or
race equality, especially as one might interpret the ethic today. I think the
lack of women in the hackerspace at MIT reflects more on the broader
intellectual climate of the time. Indeed, the hackers of note that Levy
documents might have had discriminatory views of women, and perhaps they didn't
encourage an environment, but I think this is a fault of the environment of the
time, and perhaps the hackers personally, but not specifically of the hacker
ethic.

As far as the hackers' lack of any outside activities, while that is certainly
undesirable and can become harmful, I again don't believe it's a problem
inherent to the hacker ethic. Firstly, the hacker ethic doesn't particularly
mandate that sort of obsession. Passion and dedication, sure, but not
necessarily single-minded obsession. Also, for the MIT hackers, their lifestyle
was their choice, and I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing. There are
certainly more harmful and less productive things to consume one's life.

While I don't think that I would consider myself a "true hacker," it's certainly a title worthy of aspiration.
