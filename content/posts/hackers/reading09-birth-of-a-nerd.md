Firstly, Linus (or his editor) needs to decide if he's writing in present or past tense. He constantly shift back and forth (even in the same paragraph), and it's maddening.

Grammatical criticism aside, I've really enjoyed reading Linus's memoir. In fact, I relate fairly well to his story of growing up as a nerd. No, I wasn't nearly as antisocial as Linus, nor was I quite the programming prodigy, but growing up I definitely preferred playing video games in a dark room on a Friday night over going out to play sports or go to parties.

No, I wasn't programming my father's computer in grade school. My passion for computers in grade school was mainly limited to video games (and breaking Windows XP on my Dell Pentium III box trying to make it look like Mac OS X, but that's a different story...), but I think that's mainly a reflection of the different era in which I grew up (compared to Linus), rather than my interest and passion for technology coming from any fundamentally different place. In fact, in middle and high school I did on multiple different occasions decide I was going to teach myself how to program, and usually lost interest/got frustrated because the sorts of programs that a beginner middle schooler can write while following online tutorials are singularly dull, especially compared to the advanced graphical interfaces of the games and applications I was used to using on a daily basis, especially since most of my desire to learn to program at the time stemmed from a desire to be able to create video games, and my fantasies were of coding up AAA-level games in a couple of weeks. Had I instead grown up using DOS and Unix-based text terminals, I think those beginning programming tutorials would have been much more engaging to grade-school Ethan.

Linus's story is also inspiring because of his unique journey to technological celebrity. Other tech giants like Bill Gates or Steve Jobs got to their positions not necessarily by some incredible technical prowess but from being in the right place at the right time and from a series of very successful business decisions. Linus's story, on the other hand, does not involve business, and is purely an example of what a great technical mind can contribute to the world, given the opportunity and desire to do so. Certainly he benefitted from circumstance to some degree—he was in college at point in time when Unix/Minix was simple enough to be completely understood and (mostly) recreated by one college student, and the open-source/free software movement was in its infancy.

Personally, I think it's a story any nerd or hacker would aspire to—the chance to create something that goes on to be used by billions around the world and to change the technology world, something which has become harder and harder to do as modern software becomes more and more complex (being able to stay in college for 7 years for free would be nice too).
