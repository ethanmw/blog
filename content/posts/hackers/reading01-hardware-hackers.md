Is compromising ideals (abandoning parts of the Hacker Ethic) worth having a
larger impact on the world (and coincidently more financial success)?"

The hardware hackers of 70s California (what would ultimately become Silicon
Valley) thought that it was vital to spread computing to the masses, rejecting
the ivory tower of MIT's AI lab. It was this attitude that eventually led to the
creation of the first microcomputers—computers that could fit in your living
room, not just in university labs or corporate offices. Computers like the
Altair 8800 and the Apple II were inconceivable to the giants of computing: IBM,
HP, and the like. Even Intel, which invented the microprocessor in the 4004 and
later the 8008 and 8080 which allowed these new machines to be built, didn't
really perceive a market for "personal computing."

The "true hackers" of MIT disapproved of the California hardware hackers—the denizens of MIT were focused on bumming assembly instructions from their subroutines and having arcane arguments in the TMRC room. They considered BASIC, the language of choice for the Californians, a "fascist language" because of its limitations.
