Welcome to my new blog. I've been meaning to set this up for quite a while now, but never really got around to it. I was finally given some incentive when I started a class called [Hackers in the Bazaar](https://www3.nd.edu/~pbui/teaching/cse.40842.sp19/), which required a blog to post responses to class readings (those responses can be found [here](/posts/hackers)).

That said, I hope to use this blog for much more than just assigned posts. I plan to use it as a space to write about random things, including technology and programming, politics, and who knows what else. Hopefully the posts are somewhat intelligent, and I doubt many people if at all will read them, but it seems like a fun idea anyway.
